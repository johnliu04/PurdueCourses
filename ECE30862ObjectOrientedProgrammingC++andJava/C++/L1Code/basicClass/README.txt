Compile mainPerson.cpp and Person.cpp together.

Compile mainStudent.cpp, Student.cpp and Person.cpp together to see how inheritance works

Compile mainStudentBad.cpp, Student.cpp and Person.cpp together.  This demonstrates how class attributes (variables) can be changed from methods not in the class (main, in this example) when those attributes are declared public. 

Compile mainStudentE.cpp, StudentE.cpp and Person.cpp together to see how privat can be used to enforce encapsulation and prevent main from changing the value of studentID.

Compile mainStudentPoly.cpp Student.cpp Person.cpp to see a simple example of polymorphism, where a Student object is used as a Person object.
