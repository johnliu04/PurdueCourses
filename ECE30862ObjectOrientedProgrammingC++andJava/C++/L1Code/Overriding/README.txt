This is the code that goes along with the overriding table.

In HH the base class and the derived class both have, i.e., declare and define, m( ).

In HN the base class has, i.e., declares and defines, m( ),  but the derived class does not.

In NH the derived class has, i.e., declares and defines, m( ), but the derived class does not.

In NN neither the derived nor the base class declare and define m( ).

Erroroneous statements are commented out in most of the programs.

Compile all .cpp files together within each NN, NH, HN, HH subdirectory.
